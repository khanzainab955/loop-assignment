Q3. What are loops, and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and
examples.

Loops are a programming construct that allows us to execute a block of code repeatedly, as long as a certain condition is met. Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.

1)while loop: Iterates elements for an infinite number of times. The syntax is:
While(condition){

Code//
}

Example:
var i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
2)do while loop: Iterates elements for an infinite number of times. The code is executed at least once whether the condition is true or false. The syntax is:

do(
code to be executed
) while (condition);


Example:
var i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);

3)for in loop: Iterates the properties of an object. JavaScript loops are mostly used in arrays. The syntax is:
for(variable in object)
{
code to be executed
}

Example:
var obj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "New York"
};

for (var prop in obj) {
  console.log(prop + ": " + obj[prop]);
}


4) for of loop: Iterates the values of an iterable object. The syntax is:
for(variable of iterable)
{
code to be executed
}


Example:

var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

for (var value of arr) {
  console.log(value);
}
